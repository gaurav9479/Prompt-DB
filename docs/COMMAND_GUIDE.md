## Tips for Better Commands

### Be Specific
Instead of: `update product`
Try: `update product 5 price 49.99`

### Use Natural Language
You don't need exact syntax. These all work:
- `verify shop 5`
- `approve shop 5`
- `approve shop number 5`

### Include Relevant Details
For shop registration:
```
add shop "Tech Hub" owner "John Doe" email john@test.com city "Mumbai"
```

For product creation:
```
create product "Widget Pro" price 99.99 quantity 100 brand "Acme"
```

### Use Autocomplete
- Start typing to see suggestions
- Press **Arrow Down/Up** to navigate
- Press **Enter** to select a suggestion
- Press **Escape** to close suggestions

### Destructive Actions Need Confirmation
Commands like `delete`, `cancel`, and `suspend` will ask for confirmation before executing.
